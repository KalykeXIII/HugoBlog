My name is Kyle Herbertson, a current university student studying Mathematics and Computational Science. 

Inspired by the cool stuff my good friend [Alfie Chadwick](https://deploy-preview-3--fonzzys-projects.netlify.app/about/) has been up 
to, I figured I may as well set up a place to share and explore the random stuff I find cool or useful.

If this ever turns out to be any good and you want to get in touch/work on something together
hit me up on LinkedIn or at kyleh898@gmail.com!
